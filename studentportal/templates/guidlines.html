<li>Community Work (CW) is a 2 credit activity and the student is expected to complete <strong>80 hours</strong> of work in it.</li>

<li>The student first needs to find an organisation to work with. The student should decide whether he/she might be working with an NGO or working on something of their own in a group under the guidance of a faculty.</li>
<li>
After discussing with the concerned organisation, the student must add their project in this portal. Any information which could not be completely conveyed in the form must be uploaded as a 'Proposal' file in the upload files section of the project<a href="{% static 'form_layouts/proposal.pdf' %}"> in this format.</a></li>
<li>After submitting the proposal, the student should wait for a mail accepting their proposal before starting the work. Once the proposal is accepted, the student can continue working on it until he/she has completed the required number of hours. Meanwhile, the student needs to keep uploading the logs (signed by the supervisor) in upload files section of the project.</li>

<li>After completion the student is expected to prepare a report in the <a href="{% static 'form_layouts/submission.pdf' %}">format specified here </a>. The report should be submitted within one year of acceptance of the proposal, failing which the student has to start afresh, from submitting the proposal. Together with the report, a completion certificate from the organization where he/she did the CW activity is to be submitted.</li>

<li>The student also has to prepare a poster (or set of 8-10 slides). There will be a poster session every semester (during the first 2-3 weeks) wherein the student has to  present the activity undertaken by him/her.</li>

<li>All of report, poster and completion certificate are necessary for the student to be considered for evaluation. The earned credits will occur as a note in the final the transcript.</li>
